Summary of Constructor And Destructor:::

Explanation of the Code
Constructor (__init__): The __init__ method initializes the brand and model attributes of the Car class and prints a message when the object is created.

Destructor (__del__): The __del__ method prints a message when the object is destroyed. This is triggered automatically when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted using the del keyword.

Object Creation: An object my_car is created with the brand "Toyota" and model "Corolla". The constructor is called automatically.

Object Deletion: The del keyword is used to explicitly delete the my_car object, which triggers the destructor.
