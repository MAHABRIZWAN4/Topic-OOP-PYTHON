Q1) What is OOP?
Ans) **OOP in Python** means writing code using **objects**.

An **object** is something that has:

* **Data** (called attributes)
* **Functions** (called methods)

OOP helps us to:

* Keep code clean
* Reuse code
* Make big programs easier to manage

Python uses **classes** to create objects.



Q2) What is an Attribute?
Ans) ### **Easy Definition of Attribute in Python:**

An attribute in Python is a variable inside a class that stores information about an object.

---

### **Example:**

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, color, brand):
        self.color = color      # attribute
        self.brand = brand      # attribute

my_car = Car("Red", "Toyota")

print(my_car.color)   # Output: Red
print(my_car.brand)   # Output: Toyota
```

---

### **Explanation (Easy Words):**

* `color` and `brand` are **attributes** of the `Car` object.
* They tell us **what color** and **which brand** the car is.
* `self.color = color` means we are **saving** the color inside the object.
  


Q3)  What is __init__?
Ans) The __init__ method is a special function that runs automatically when we create an object from the class.
It is used to initialize (set) the object's attributes.



Q4) Who invented oop?
Inventors: Ole-Johan Dahl & Kristen Nygaard

Country: Norway

First OOP Language: Simula (around 1967)

Purpose: To model real-world things using objects in programming


Q5) What is in object?
Ans) An object is an instance of a class


Q6) What is class?
Ans) Which is a blueprint for creating objects


Q7) Why the self keyword is used?
Ans) The self keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class.


Q8) How Objects are created? 
Ans) Objects are created by calling the class name like a function.
